Flat Shading------
object is illuminated only by directional light sources and is either diffuse or viewed from infinitely far away

Objects look like they are composed of polygons
- OK for polyhedral objects
- Not so good for smooth surfaces

shade each polygon of an object based on the angle between the polygon's surface normal and
the direction of the light source, their respective colors and the intensity of the light source.


Gouraud Shading----
Determine the normal at each polygon vertex
Apply an illumination model to each vertex to calculate the vertex intensity
Interpolate the vertex intensities using bilinear interpolation over the surface polygon
One lighting calculation per vertex

Phong shading------
Phong shading is similar to Gouraud shading, except that the Normals are interpolated. Thus, the specular highlights are computed much more precisely than in the Gouraud shading model:

Compute a normal N for each vertex of the polygon.
From bilinear interpolation compute a normal, Ni for each pixel. (This must be renormalized each time)
From Ni compute an intensity Ii for each pixel of the polygon.
Paint pixel to shade corresponding to Ii.
