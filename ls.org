After every little UX/UI change, the first challenged thing is to pass the test cases about preferences.
There are about 1000s test cases that we need to take care.
The test cases can detect defects or bugs of our modification. 
Most test cases about preferences simulates human behaviors on Firefox.

Zack and I had some difficulties during the development.

We re-arranges about:preferences, so the content changes. 
However, the old test cases is based on the old about:preferences.
For examples, it used to have a button there, but now there is no button.
So we need to re-write these test caes. Sometimes failing 100s of test cases is normal thing.

Another difficulty is that sometimes its hard to find out why we fail the test cases.
Because test case simulation goes really fast, its hard to see what simulation doing.
So, we can look at the code, but sometimes it looks fine at all.
We need to break the test cases case by case and add code to slow it down to see what simulation doing. 
Eventually, we found out that the button didn't show in the windows.
We need to scroll down to see it.

At the end, we also need to pass all other test cases for the whole firefox.

Probe, Mozilla UI/UX team can utilize these datat to improve firefox in the future.
